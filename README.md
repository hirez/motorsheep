Hysterical raisins.

It's a 5.25" floppy drive alignment tool for DOS.

This is going to make about as much sense and be about as relevant as a 'theory of operation' document for a paraffin-lamp
mantle knitting robot. Probably less relevant, because something like that would at least be all brass and mahogany and
surrounded by admiring steampunks, wondering if they could get away with wrenching the cogs off the thing in order to
decorate their hats.

So. Back in the old days before colour, SMS and postmodern irony was invented, but while Rick Astley was still in the
charts with 'Never gonna give you up', people used things called floppy drives to move data between computers. They were
something like rubbish USB keys that were flat and went round and round like a Technics 1200. Originally they were eight
inches across (Inches were a bit like crap centimetres only too big to be useful. Using inches and stuff where you
should be using centimetres makes spacecraft fall out of the sky unexpectedly.), but the relentless march of technology
shrank them to 5 1/4 inches, then 3 1/2 inches and then they became too small to see so people forgot to put them in
computers any more. There's a big warehouse of tiny floppy drives out past Leominster.

Because they were mechanical, they would quickly fill up with jam and cat hair. Or fire would come out or they'd get a
monk on and eat all the data on the disk. When that happened, you'd have to take them out of the computer, tip the jam
and cat hair out and then connect them to a really expensive piece of equipment which would allow a specially trained
technician in a brown coat to re-align the read/write heads. (No, really. Hardware disk exercisers and the (analogue)
test disks were silly money.)

I was working for a set of gits who didn't want to spend the money on a disk-exerciser, but had a stable-load (no,
really) of dodgy drives that they wanted me to repair. So I hacked this up for spite because People On Cix said it
couldn't be done.

CIX?

You don't want to know.

Why?

It's twenty-five years old. It's magestically irrelevant. The platform and compiler no longer exist. (Oh god I work with
people who're younger than code I wrote and gave away.) I think we called it 'shareware' in those days.
